# Finance-for-big-data: Tracking our progresses
First session: 7/11

What we have done:

- create a github repository where we track (in text format) what we are doing, with a frequency, I would say, of max 1 week
- made a list of possible use cases:

1.Supply chain tracking in the fashion industry (from raw material to final product). That might be of interest for both companies and customers to certify sustainability & prevent counterfeits to enter the market -->vote here Valentina A 
2.Food chain tracking system: making sure that crossing borders and enter different food market is compliant with regulations https://www.blockchain4innovation.it/brand/walmart/  -->vote here: Valentina A 
3.Carbon emissions tracking and standardization + carbon market regulation (https://www.infosys.com/oracle/white-papers/documents/carbon-supply-chain-blockchain-technology.pdf) -->vote here

Letâ€™s put your name beside the idea you like the most!

Actions by Saturday 14th:
- pick one of this use cases
- market research - where is the highest demand? (document in drive)
- have a draft of the architecture
- so some market research about the demand for this technology
- have an idea of how to sell it to one (or more) company
